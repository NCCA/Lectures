## Our Philosophy

<myquote>
Since its inception, the philosophy of our centre has been to marry Art and Science in order to facilitate the production of Computer Animation, Digital Effects and Computer Games. <br>Our centre is truly interdisciplinary and is populated by an integrated team of technical and creative people.<br> Our motto is “Science in the service of the Arts” and reflects our attitude towards the mix of the arts and sciences in our teaching and research.

## CGAL

- Computer Graphics Animation Language
  - but so much more
  - In house animation tools (remember it's 1990 not much around)
- Power Animator was the Industry standard but needed IRIX / SGI machines and £7K a seat!

## Coding Animation

```
SCRIPT 1 TO 150 DO
  BEGIN
    FROM 1 TO 100 EVERY 25 LOOP 10 DO
      RZ [ball] 1.5;
      .....
  END;

```

- This generates 150 frames of animation 
  - makes the object ```[ball]``` rotate around the z axis by 1.5 degrees in loops of 10 frames every 25 
  - i.e. 1-10  26-35 51-60 76-85
