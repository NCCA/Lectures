## Our Philosophy

<myquote>
Since its inception, the philosophy of our centre has been to marry Art and Science in order to facilitate the production of Computer Animation, Digital Effects and Computer Games. <br>Our centre is truly interdisciplinary and is populated by an integrated team of technical and creative people.<br> Our motto is “Science in the service of the Arts” and reflects our attitude towards the mix of the arts and sciences in our teaching and research.

## 1990

- here are two of the earliest animations from the NCCA archive

<div id="mySlideLeft">

    <source data-src="videos/Computer_Animation_Festival_1990_video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</div>
<div id="mySlideRight">

## CGAL

- Computer Graphics Animation Language
  - but so much more
  - In house animation tools (remember it's 1990 not much around)
- Power Animator was the Industry standard but needed IRIX / SGI machines and £7K a seat!

## Coding Animation
<div id="mySlideLeftCode">
<iframe src="sphere.html" ></iframe>
</div>
<div id="mySlideRightCode">
```
SCRIPT 1 TO 150 DO
  BEGIN
    FROM 1 TO 100 EVERY 25 LOOP 10 DO
      RZ [ball] 1.5;
      .....
  END;
```
</div>
- This generates 150 frames of animation 
  - makes the object ```[ball]``` rotate around the z axis by 1.5 degrees in loops of 10 frames every 25 
  - i.e. 1-10  26-35 51-60 76-85

## Equipment 

- HP (Apollo) computers
  - HP UX 
- Needed to know shell and how to use Unix (csh)
- Also taught some perl (to help automate tasks)
- Late 90's moved to SGI O2 (looked great!)

## OpenGL and C

- Once we got the SGI's we had access to the new API OpenGL
  - Version 1.1 on the SGI 
  - Started teaching C and OpenGL
- I still teach OpenGL today (more later)
